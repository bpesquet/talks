= Decision-making, learning and confidence in natural cognition

== Decision-making as a sequential process

#pause

- A _decision_ is a deliberative process leading to a _choice_.

#pause

- Decision-makers need _time_ to collect and process informative cues.

#pause

- Decision-making is often modeled as an _accumulation-to-threshold_ process @goldNeuralBasisDecision2007.

#pause

- The balance between response time and choice accuracy (when available) is called the _Speed/Accuracy Trade-off_ @heitzSpeedaccuracyTradeoffHistory2014.

== Models of sequential decision-making

A popular model for binary decisions is the _Diffusion Decision Model_ @ratcliffDiffusionDecisionModel2008.

#figure(
  image("images/forstmannSequentialSamplingModels2016_1.png", width: 55%),
  caption: [Illustration of the DDM model @forstmannSequentialSamplingModels2016.],
)

---

In the DDM, evidence is accumulated through @ddm.

$ dif x = v dif t + s W $ <ddm>

- $x$: accumulated evidence.
- $v$: drift rate (speed of evidence accumulation).
- $dif t$: time unit.
- $W$: within-trial accumulation white noise.
- $s$: standard deviation of $W$.

---

Multi-alternative decisions are often modeled as a _race_ between accumulators, each one representing a possible choice.

#figure(
  image("images/race_model_example.gif", width: 41%),
  caption: [Illustration of a race model (#link("https://github.com/itsdfish/SequentialSamplingModels.jl")[Source]).],
)

== Learning and decision-making

#pause

- Decisions followed by _rewards_ produce _learning effects_.

#pause

- Joint models of decision-making combine evidence accumulation and Reinforcement Learning to account for these effects @mileticNewModelDecision2021.

---

Q-values adjusted through delta update rule (@delta_update_rule) are combined to drive accumulators (@rl_ddm) @fontanesiReinforcementLearningDiffusion2019.

$ Q_(i,t+1) = Q_(i,t) + alpha(r_t - Q_(i,t)) $ <delta_update_rule>
$ dif x = w(Q_(1,t) - Q_(2,t))dif t + s W $ <rl_ddm>

- $Q_(i,t)$: value representation of choice $i$ on trial $t$.
- $r_t$: reward received on trial $t$.
- $alpha in [0,1]$: learning rate. $w$: weighting factor.

== Confidence in decision-making

#pause

- _Uncertainty_ is inherent to all stages of neural computation @flemingMetacognitionConfidenceReview.

#pause

- Our brain might be able to manipulate uncertainties as _probability distributions_ @meynielConfidenceBayesianProbability2015.

#pause

- _Confidence_ quantifies the degree of _certainty_ associated with a decision.

#pause

- More formally, confidence can be defined as the _probability that a choice is correct given available evidence_ @pougetConfidenceCertaintyDistinct2016.

== Computing confidence in sequential decision-making

In _decisional focus models_, confidence is directly indexed by the state of evidence at the time of choice.

#figure(
  image("images/kepecsNeuralCorrelatesComputation2008_1.png", width: 36%),
  caption: [Computation of confidence based on the difference between accumulators at choice time @kepecsNeuralCorrelatesComputation2008.],
)

---

_Post-decisional focus models_ posit that evidence accumulation goes on after decision time to account for confidence.

#figure(
  image("images/pleskacTwostageDynamicSignal2010_1.png", width: 52%),
  caption: [Computation of confidence based on post-choice accumulation @pleskacTwostageDynamicSignal2010.],
)

== Confidence as a doorway to metacognition

#pause

- _Metacognition_ is the ability to monitor and regulate one's cognitive processes @flavellMetacognitionCognitiveMonitoring1979.
  - Example: should I study more or differently for an upcoming exam?

#pause

- As part of metacognitive monitoring, confidence judgments may inform the processes of _cognitive control_ @flemingHowMeasureMetacognition2014.

= Building a cognitively plausible metacognitive agent #emoji.construction

== Core ideas

#pause

- Give our agent the capacity to learn a set of _behavioral rules_.

#pause

- Model decision-making by choosing between the multiple possible rules through evidence accumulation.

#pause

- Use confidence to adjust the hyperparameters of decision (e.g. accumulation thresholds) as a first step towards metacognition.
